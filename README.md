<h1>The perfectionist manifesto</h1>

<p>The most common view of perfectionism is that it is counter-productive, even though perfectionism is one of the most powerful tools for humanity, if it weren't for it, we would still be hunter-gatherers, but from what place this distorted view comes from? It comes from a bad definition.</p>

<p>If you ask most people what is perfectionism they will answer "trying to make things perfect", which is a good definition, but often they mean that perfectionism is trying to make EVERYTHING perfect, which is a TERRIBLE definiton, we can compare to thinking a bricklayer tries to build everything with bricks, but perfectionism is a tool.</p>

<p>We should strive to make perfectionism a mode, in which we can be perfectionist or not perfectionist in a will, why we should do this? Because, if you are at everything a perfectionist or never one, you will either build nothing or become complacent.</p>

<p>Someone that is a perfectionist at everything will never do anything, because perfectionism is costly, you need to devote countless hours and energy at it, i could for example, try to perfect this website (gwern style), but it would be too much of hassle for too little gain.</p>

<p>But if never try to perfect anything, nothing you do will be truly great work, there are zero achievements that didn't require perfection, ZERO, every piece of great work isn't "just good enough" by the definition of the word.</p>

<p>This is why perfectionists always win, they make the best products, the best art and the best science, and this should be truism, perfectionists can spot flaws that most don't notice, think of the macintosh, most people didn't think that computers needed to be beautiful, but the perfectionism of the people at apple noticed that, yes, computers should be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>When you have something that you really care about, strive to make it as perfect as it can be, but be careful, perfectionism is just a tool, and like a hammer, and you can hurt yourself with it too.</p>
